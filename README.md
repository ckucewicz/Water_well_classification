## Background
The country of Tanzania is struggling to provide safe, clean water to its more than 67 million citizens. A non-governmental organization (NGO) is assisting the Tanzanian government in addressing this critical issue by repairing damaged water wells. With over 70k water wells scattered across an area larger than twice the size of California, testing every single well is both costly and time-consuming.

Water from these wells is not only vital for drinking but also essential for cooking, sanitation, and hygiene practices. Ensuring access to clean water significantly impacts the health and livelihoods of the community. Therefore, the NGO requires an efficient method to identify which water wells need repair, streamlining their efforts to provide safe, clean water for all Tanzanians.

## Business Goals
The primary focus of this machine learning project is to assist the NGO in identifying all water wells requiring repair, enabling timely interventions to ensure safe, clean water for Tanzanians. The project aims to accurately identify every positive case (water well in need of repair) while minimizing false negatives, which occur when a well is incorrectly classified as functioning properly when, in reality, it is in need of repair.

Although some functional wells may be incorrectly flagged as needing repair, the prevention of potential health hazards is of utmost importance. Therefore, the model prioritizes accurately identifying wells that truly need repair, erring on the side of caution, thereby safeguarding the lives of citizens who depend on these essential water sources.

## Business Success Criteria
The success of this project will be measured primarily by the model’s recall metric, which addresses the question: “Out of all the wells that actually need repair, what percentage did our model correctly identify as needing repair?” Recall is calculated by dividing the number of true positives (the number of wells that genuinely require repair) by the combined total of true positives and false negatives (the wells that require repair but were incorrectly labeled as functional). 

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac {\text{True  Positives}}{\text{True  Positives + False  Negatives}}
